## Hey 👋, I'm <a href="/#">Mina Magdy</a>

As a senior computer science student at Suez Canal University, I have consistently excelled in my academic journey. 👀 passionate about competitive programming and problem-solving with C++. I am deeply immersed in the world of backend development. 🌱 I have a special affinity for JavaScript and have chosen to master Node.js, currently utilizing it in my graduation project alongside Express.js and MongoDB. 🚀

My interests extend to the realm of mathematics like [Combinatorics](https://github.com/MiinaMagdy/Combinatorics) and [Geometry](https://github.com/MiinaMagdy/Geometry). I actively contribute to open source, 💞️ collaborate on backend projects, and find joy in daily LeetCode challenges. Always eager to learn and share knowledge! 💡👩‍💻
